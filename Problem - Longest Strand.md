Given a large number of binary files, write a program that finds the
longest strand of bytes that is identical between two or more files

Use the test set attached (files sample.*)

The program should display:
- the length of the strand
- the file names where the largest strand appears
- the offset where the strand appears in each file


FILE sample.1 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 8872 , Index Location: 4
FILE sample.10 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 10040 , Index Location: 47
FILE sample.2 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 9776 , Index Location: 16
FILE sample.3 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 9776 , Index Location: 66
FILE sample.4 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 8872 , Index Location: 14
FILE sample.5 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 8872 , Index Location: 14
FILE sample.6 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 8872 , Index Location: 14
FILE sample.7 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 8872 , Index Location: 14
FILE sample.8 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 8872 , Index Location: 68
FILE sample.9 : Longest Strand of Bytes: 8872 , Index Location: 39
